The design of the Product Selection catalog should be very similar to what
we have there in the Shopify.

The design can mirror for now to the one that's there in the Buy Button, in order to have
a fair comparison between each of them. It's easier to make and is minimalistic so shouldn't be hard to make either. However,
there still remains the hurdle of state being not represented right which we are going to solve now.
